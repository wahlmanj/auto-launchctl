auto-launchctl
==============

This is a script to automate permissions and load launchctl plists for you automatically.

You should copy both files to /Library/LaunchDaemons

now you can just drag and drop your plist into /Library/LaunchDaemons and restart you device or run ./auto.bash after you made it executable of course with chmod +x auto.bash

Just replace __USERNAME__ with yours in com.launchctl.plist
